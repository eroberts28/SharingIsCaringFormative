Each year, thousands of cats, dogs, small pets and horses turn to our animal hospitals, clinics and rehoming services for treatment and to find them the happy homes they deserve. 

I want my website to convey a positive message. The sad stories and petitions to inform people but the main theme focuses on the positive side and the impact that anyone can have. I will include images, stories and most importantly videos. These will demonstrate why I have chosen the cause I have but mainly the transformation of the lives and wellbeing of animals after they have had the help that they need.#

The cause of action that I want to implement are listed below:

* Offer to start a petition instead or as well as donating.
* Sign up to receive info on uplifting stories. 
* Sponsor a pet.

These will be requested from a drop down list or message box at the bottom of my page.

## The Code!

I have started to code my website, including css, javascript and attempting to make it responsive.

Now I have the basic structure for the layout, I am going to start working on the placement of each element. More specifically, ensuring margins on the left and right hand side to ensure it doesn't look too spread out. I am also going to start adding the content that I have been researching about. I have looked at petitions that are ongoing and also ways that people can and have helped.

This is my website so far:
